Comments before Week 7 check-in
==================================

1. Overall
- Make sure to push your most recent commits up to GitHub;  current versioni doesn't match what you were showing last week
- Great start -- how are you organizing tasks for project? When remains on the to-do list, and how do you prioritize it? Would you ever need to use branching for features?

2. Requirements
- Runs locally
- Front-end uses Bootstrap classes; displays components based on API data
- Routes appear to work

3. Testing
- What is your testing plan?  Mainly manual?  Any chance for automated testing?

4. Logic
- Demoed features should have good logic (beyond what's in the current commit), but have to look at latest code more in-depth to comment

5. Style
- Create readme for how to test project, either deployed or locally.  Instructions for locally running it could include shell comments for installing and running flask, loading the right url (http://127.0.0.1:5000) etc
- Good organization of files and variables
- Additional additions for improved UI/UX/accessibility as previously discussed
